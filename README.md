# 100 Days of Code

The 100 Days of Code challenge is a commitment to dedicate time daily to coding and learn new skills in Python programming language.
This challenge will help me to build consistency, establish a coding habit, and make significant progress in my programming journey.
I am trying to achieve this by coding, learning and practicing new concepts daily in Python, typically by making some small and exciting projects.


## Goals of this Challenge
Consistency : Code for a minimum of one hour every day.

Learning : Explore, learn and master new concepts.

Projects : Work on personal or collaborative projects that will give practical guide to applications of the language while also build my portfolio simultaneously.

Document Progress : Update the log file with daily progress, learnings, challenges, and achievements.

### Day 3
I learned about conditional statements and logical flow a problem. This concept is essential for my problem solving approach and flow of the problem. I learned about if, else and elif statements.
Created a simple program for generating tickets for a Roller Coaster Ride generating ticket according to the different inputs from the users like their age, height. Also created a program for checking if the year is a leap year or not.
