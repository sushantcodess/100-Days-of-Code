100 Days of Code 

The 100 Days of Code challenge is a commitment to dedicate time daily to coding and learn new skills in Python programming language. 

This challenge will help me to build consistency, establish a coding habit, and make significant progress in my programming journey. 

I am trying to achieve this by coding, learning and practicing new concepts daily in Python, typically by making some small and exciting projects.
